# Multi-rotor UAV Design for crop monitoring and pesticide spraying

Conceptual design, analysis and proof-of-concept simulation in ROS Melodic and Gazebo9. Obeys the following requirement specifications:

* Range = 5km
* Cruise altitude = 2m
* Endurance = 30min
* Tank(payload) volume = 5L

### Instructions to generate simulations:

Clone the repository, build the project using `catkin build` and run `./zigzag,sh`.
